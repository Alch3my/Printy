Figure 17. Accent Piece

Install 2 M5 standoffs and 2 M5 nuts on the carrier. Next use clear tape to hold down the removable clear print plate onto the carrier. Note the print plate is not square, please make sure the wider side goes over the left and right edge of the hole in the carrier. This print plate also gives additional tension to the FEP film (future steps). 

<img src="https://github.com/alch3my/printy/raw/master/Mechanical/Instructions/Images/F18.jpg" width="400" />

Figure 18. Standoffs and print plate

### The Build Platform
Sand the bottom of the build platform with rough sandpaper for better print adhesion. All the holes on the sides are for drainage since the build platform is partially submerged in resin at the beginning of the print. Use 4 M5x20 screws to install the build platform on the crane. For future removal, simply loosen the 4 screws and pull the print and build platform away from the crane.

<img src="https://github.com/alch3my/printy/raw/master/Mechanical/Instructions/Images/P1.jpg" width="400" />

Figure P1. Build Platform

### Reusable Resin Reservoir
This step is crucial for the quality of print, make sure to proceed slowly and ensure a water-tight finish in the end.

1. Place a ring of double sided adhesive (provided) as high as possible along the vertical reservoir exterior wall.
2. Remove FEP film from backing. FEP is clear and slightly stretchy, the backing is made of PTFE and is not stretchy.
3. Place the aluminum resin reservoir on top of the FEP film and fold the FEP around the resevoir. Make sure the FEP film is tightly stretched and well adhered to the double sided tape.
4. Cover the FEP's vertical surface with single sided tape (provided).

<img src="https://github.com/alch3my/printy/raw/master/Mechanical/Instructions/Images/R1.jpg" width="400" />

Figure R1. Completed Reservoir

Install the reservoir onto the frame using 2 M5x20 screws. The slightly thick print plate provides additional tension to the FEP film, make sure there are no bubbles or gaps between the FEP film and the print plate.

<img src="https://github.com/alch3my/printy/raw/master/Mechanical/Instructions/Images/R2.jpg" width="400" />

Figure R2. Installed Reservoir

The reservoir can be removed easily for cleaning. If worn out, the FEP can be replaced by repeating the above steps.

### Electrical Hookup Diagram
Connect all the electrical cables. Pay special attention to the following:
1. Switches: Signal (S) is green, Ground (-) is black, 5V (+) is red. Z end stop switch connects to the ZMIN port. The other door switches connect to the SAFE ports.
2. NEMA17 stepper motor: they come with 4 wires of various colors depending on manufacturer, if you later find the Z direction is reversed, just flip this connection backwards.
3. The laser module: the fan and laser power use identical connectors. The fan cable is longer and thinner.
4. The galvos: x-axis is the galvo installed vertically, it's responsible for the laser going left and right. Y-axis is the galvo installed horizontally, it's responsible for the laser going back and forth.
