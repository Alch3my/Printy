## Description
Alch3my is an open-source initiative for making the latest 3D printing technology accessible to everyone. Printy is an open-source SLA printer. We aim to democratize SLA technology with this fun and easy to build kit. Assembly takes 4 hours.

## Sourcing the Components
### Option 1: Everything from Alch3my
Purchase a complete kit. This takes all the work out of qualifying and sourcing. This option is perfect for a weekend project.
### Option 2: Only the Essentials
Do you have access to a laser cutter? Do you already have Arduino Mega, NEMA17 motor, stepper board, switches, etc from other projects? We will provide an essentials kit that includes Alch3my created hardware: the ResinShield and the aluminum sheet metal pieces.
### Option 3: From Scratch
Are you a hard core maker? Do you like to make, improve, and redistribute hardware? We will provide schematics, gerbers, firmware, CAD files and documentation at Alch3my.com or our GitHub page so you can base your next design on ours. Please observe the license and give credit to Alch3my.

## Build Instructions
### Overview
The Printy kit contains many laser cut pieces. Pay close attention to the orientation of pieces, since some of the pieces only fit together in the orientations described. All orientation directions assumes the printer is facing you. The __front__ is the side closest to you.; __left__ is on your left hand side, etc.
#### Setup
Begin by spreading all the pieces out for easy identification and to ensure you have all the necessary pieces. Please refer to the bill of materials (BOM).
#### Peel
Peel the protective tape from all pieces except for clear reservoir bottom. We do this to keep the reservoir protected as we build Printy. Note: the clear film on the reservoir has a pre-applied FEP sheet.
