## Description
Alch3my is an open-source initiative for making the latest 3D printing technology accessible to everyone. Printy is an open-source SLA printer. We aim to democratize SLA technology with this fun and easy to build kit. Assembly takes 4 hours.

## Sourcing the Components
### Option 1: Everything from Alch3my
Purchase a complete kit. This takes all the work out of qualifying and sourcing. This option is perfect for a weekend project.
### Option 2: Only the Essentials
Do you have access to a laser cutter? Do you already have Arduino Mega, NEMA17 motor, stepper board, switches, etc from other projects? We will provide an essentials kit that includes Alch3my created hardware: the ResinShield and the aluminum sheet metal pieces.
### Option 3: From Scratch
Are you a hard core maker? Do you like to make new and/or improved hardware? We will provide schematics, gerbers, firmware, CAD files and documentation at Alch3my.com so you can base your next design on ours.

## Build Instructions
### Overview
The Printy kit contains many laser cut pieces. Pay close attention to the orientation of pieces, since some of the pieces only fit together in the orientations described. All orientation directions assumes the printer is facing you. The __front__ is the side closest to you.; __left__ is on your left hand side, etc.
#### Setup
Begin by spreading all the pieces out for easy identification and to ensure you have all the necessary pieces. Please refer to the bill of materials (BOM).
#### Peel
Peel the protective tape from all pieces except for clear reservoir bottom. We do this to keep the reservoir protected as we build Printy. Note: the clear film on the reservoir has a pre-applied FEP sheet.

#### T-Slot Joints
Printy is held together by T-slot joints. A bolt is inserted through one interface and a nut is inserted into a slot on the receiving end. __Do not overtighten!__

### Building the Crane
The crane holds the print platform, all holes are symmetric for your convenience. The two holes are for attaching the endstop switch, use the holes on the __front-right__.

Figure C1.

Attach the front and back piece of the crane to the top of the crane with 4 M3 nuts and 4 M3x14 screws each. A total of 8 M3 nuts and 8 M3x14 screws will be used.

Figure C2.

Attach the NEMA17 motor to top of the crane with 4 M3x10 screws. Wires should come out on the __right__ side.

Figure C5.

Attach the endstop switch with 2 M3x16 screw and 2 M3 nuts. The wires should points towards the __right__ side.
